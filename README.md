# NextAuth Example ðŸš€

This Project is a simple NextAuth example using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/).
I only implemented the azure-ad provider, but you can easily add more providers. You can also use it as a simple starter template for your next project.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
